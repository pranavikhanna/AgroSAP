ðŸŒ± AgroSAP: AI-Powered Soil Remediation Platform

AgroSAP is a scrappy MVP for an AI-powered soil remediation platform that uses superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) to capture heavy metals in contaminated soil. This project originated from the Little Bang UC Davis Pitch Competition, where it won $1,000 in seed funding. AgroSAP aims to empower farmers with actionable, data-driven insights to optimize soil health and ensure sustainable agricultural practices.


## Project Features

- Data Modeling:
  Python-based absorption model to predict SAP efficiency based on metal concentration levels in the soil.

- Simulation Engine:
  Remediation simulation calculates impact over time and tracks improvements in soil condition.

- Supabase Integration:
  Cloud backend using Supabase to store and manage soil sample data in real time.

- RESTful API:
  Flask-based API (`/simulate`) to integrate with external services or future mobile/web clients.

- Interactive Dashboard:
  Built with Streamlit to upload CSVs, run models, visualize contamination levels, and show remediation predictions.

- HashMap Data Structure:
  Fast lookup of soil samples by ID to support efficient querying and expansion into field-level analysis.

- C++ Backend Stub:
  Simple absorption calculation function written in C++ for future performance-critical simulations.
